# ProbablyFriends
This is an example project that uses a Jenkins pipeline I setup. Thanks for checking it out!

## Overview

The details of the Jenkins pipeline are documented in this readme along with steps to recreate the work I've done. This repository contains a simple ASP .NET 6 web application with Razor pages and a unit test project. The script for the Jenkins pipeline is listed at the bottom of this README in a code block along with a deployment script written in Python.

## Setting up the .NET Project

From Visual Studio 2022 I created a new ASP .NET Core Web App project and selected .NET 6.0 for the framework. I wanted to showcase running unit tests as a build step in the pipeline, so I added a XUnit test project to the solution as well. Within Index.cshtml.cs I wrote a very simple method that returns a list of three names:

```C#
  public List<string> GetFriendNames()
  {
      return new List<string> { "Matt", "Michael", "Andrew" };
  }
```
In order to test this method, I wrote a single unit test that checks that the method really does return three names:

```C#
  [Fact]
  public void AreThreeFriendNamesReturned_GetFriendNames()
  {
      IndexModel indexModel = new IndexModel();

      List<string> friendNames = indexModel.GetFriendNames();

      Assert.True(friendNames.Count == 3);
  }
```
Before heading over to Jenkins, I set the project up in source control by selecting the "Add to Source Control" option and creating a public repository on GitHub.

## Configuring the Jenkins Pipeline

After installing Jenkins I created a new Pipeline project. The first configuration I setup was for the GitHub project, selecting the options for GitHub under the general. I then started making the build steps.

### Parameters

This is a string parameter that is fed into the Python script that handles the deployment.
```
DEPLOY_TARGET_PATH
```

This is a string parameter that is also used in the deployment script for determining where backups of the last deploy should be stored.
```
DEPLOY_BACKUP_PATH
```

Another string parameter used as an argument for the runtime when publishing the web app.
```
RUNTIME
```

### Build Steps

The first step is building the entire solution. If this step fails, then there is a problem with either the unit test project or the main project.

```
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

The next step is to run the unit tests. If any tests fail then the pipeline fails.

```
dotnet test
```

The final step in the build is to publish the artifacts. In this case the .NET framework is bundled with the application using the "self-contained" argument.

```
dotnet publish ProbablyFriends --configuration Release --runtime %RUNTIME% --self-contained
```

### Post-Build Steps

Following a successful build the deployment script will kick off using the below command.

```
python Deploy.py "%WORKSPACE%\ProbablyFriends\bin\Release\net6.0\win-x64\publish" "%DEPLOY_TARGET_PATH%" "%DEPLOY_BACKUP_PATH%"
```

Below are the contents of the deployment script. The script will stop the Windows service that hosts the web app, create a backup, move the artifacts to the target folder, and then start the service back up. If an exception occurs during the deployment then a roll back will occur and restore the app to the backup.

```Python
import datetime
import shutil
import os
import sys

_current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
_file_time_stamp = f"{_current_time.year}-{_current_time.hour}-{_current_time.minute}-{_current_time.second}"
_file_name = f"deployment-{_file_time_stamp}"
_backup_file_name = f'backup-{_file_time_stamp}'


def run_deploy(source_path, target_path, backup_path):
    print(f"Running deploy for target path: {target_path}")

    try:
        # Stop Service
        print("Stopping service...")
        os.system("sc stop ProbablyFriends")

        # Create backup
        print("Creating backup...")
        shutil.make_archive(os.path.join(
            backup_path, _backup_file_name), 'zip', target_path)
        
        # Zip artifacts and copy to target
        print("Zipping artifacts and copying to target...")
        shutil.make_archive(
            os.path.join(target_path, _file_name), 'zip', source_path)

        # Unzip artifacts
        print("Unpacking artifacts...")
        shutil.unpack_archive(os.path.join(
            target_path, f"{_file_name}.zip"), target_path)

        # Delete archive
        print("Deleting archive...")
        os.remove(os.path.join(target_path, f"{_file_name}.zip"))

        # Start Service
        print("Starting Service...")
        os.system("sc start ProbablyFriends")

    except:
        roll_back(target_path, backup_path)

    print("Done!")


def roll_back(target_path, backup_path):
    print(f"An Exception occured. Rolling back deploy.")
    os.remove(target_path)
    os.write(target_path, 'x')
    shutil.unpack_archive(os.path.join(
        backup_path, f"{_backup_file_name}.zip"), target_path)


run_deploy(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3])

```


### Email Notification on Build Failures

I configued Jenkins to use Gmail's SMTP server. Upon any failures an email is sent out to my email address with the console output attached and another email is sent out following a succesful build after a failure.

## Creating the Windows Service

I used the following PowerShell command to create a new Windows Service. By default Kestrel uses port 5000 to host the app.

```PowerShell
New-Service -Name ProbablyFriends -BinaryPathName "C:\APPLICATIONS\ProbablyFriends\ProbablyFriends.exe" -Description "Probably Friends Web App" -DisplayName "Probably Friends" -StartupType Automatic
```

## Pipeline Script

```GROOVY
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone Sources') {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://github.com/andrewettensohn/ProbablyFriends.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                bat 'dotnet build --configuration Release'

                bat 'dotnet test'

                bat 'dotnet publish ProbablyFriends --configuration Release --runtime %RUNTIME% --self-contained'

                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'ProbablyFriends/bin/Release/net6.0/**/*', followSymlinks: false
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                bat 'python Deploy.py "%WORKSPACE%\\ProbablyFriends\\bin\\Release\\net6.0\\win-x64\\publish" "%DEPLOY_TARGET_PATH%" "%DEPLOY_BACKUP_PATH%"'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        failure {
            emailext attachLog: true,
             to: 'andrewettensohn@gmail.com',
             body: 'The console output of the job has been attached to this email. Build URL: ${BUILD_URL}',
             subject: 'Build failed in Jenkins: Probably Friends ${BUILD_NUMBER}'
        }
        fixed {
            emailext attachLog: false,
            to: 'andrewettensohn@gmail.com',
            body: 'Build URL: ${BUILD_URL}',
            subject: 'Jenkins build is back to normal: Probably Friends ${BUILD_NUMBER}'
        }
    }
}


```
